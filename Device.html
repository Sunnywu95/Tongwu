  <h1>AUTO-MECHANIC EXTRUDER FOR LIPOSOME PREPARATION</h1>
  <p>The Auto-Mechanic Extruder for Liposome Preparation is a project aimed at designing and implementing a fully functional automechanic machine to replace manual extrusion processes in liposome preparation. The machine is built to fix an Avanti mini-extruder onto a heat-controlled platform and control the liposome filtering process using an actuator capable of producing linear motion.</p>

  <p>With the ability to run continuously for hours, the machine saves time and effort for researchers, producing liposomes that are closer to an ideal solution. It maintains a constant temperature and flow rate throughout the entire filtering process, ensuring precise liposome production. The custom clamping mechanism allows for easy clamping or releasing of the Avanti mini-extruder, while the computer interface enables the input of desired temperature, speed rate, and the number of cycles for filtering various lipid buffer solutions. Loading and starting the machine with a new sample takes only seconds.</p>

  <p>The practical design of the machine allows for potential upgrades to enhance efficiency. It can be adapted to create a variety of simple yet fully reliable automated systems for similar manual processes, enabling labs using the extrusion method or those looking to enter the field to produce liposomes more quickly and accurately.</p>
