    <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website!</p>
    <img src="assets/Tong Wu.JPG" alt="Tong Wu" style="width: 150px; height: auto;">

    <p>I'm Tong Wu, a passionate scientist with a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Temple University. My background in physical chemistry and analytical chemistry has led me to gain interdisciplinary experience in fields such as microbiology, cell biology and medical device.</p>
    <a href="about_me.html">About Me</a>

    <p>During my Ph.D., I made contributions to the field by focusing on the application of nonlinear spectroscopy and microscopy techniques to study membrane properties. As an avid "membrane enthusiast," I've been able to gain a better understanding of the effects of medicine and environmental factors on membrane properties. My current research involves investigating the differences between cancer cell membranes and normal cell membranes. This work is critical for advancing our knowledge of membrane behavior and has the potential to greatly impact medical research and treatments in the future.</p>

    <p>In addition to research, I have experience in mentoring and teaching. As a Team Advisor and Supervisor for the Senior Design Project in the College of Engineering, I guided students in research methodology and experimental techniques while inventing and constructing an electronically controlled extruder for liposome preparation.</p>
